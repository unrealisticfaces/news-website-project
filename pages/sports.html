                <br>Hardly breaking a sweat through the national finals, the quintet of MVP Syrell “Chuuya Gemu” Rabara, Christian “Ramee” Tiglao, Charles Ryan “Saint Mocha” Robianes, Jerzy “Jerzy” Esguerra, and Jehoram Kish “Azelff” Espinosa did not even drop a single game in the round robin stage and semifinals before proving to be on a class of its own in the finale against the Bulldogs. <br>

                <br>Panthera, however, would not be denied as it finally took care of business with an 11-7 Game 4 win to bag the title as well as the top prize of P100,000. <br>
