            <p>The next triple threat in Philippine musical theater is here. <br>

                <br>Former Philippine Madrigal Singer Zadkiel John "Zid" Yarcia has made his musical theater debut on Repertory Philippines' "Going Home to Christmas," a musical featuring the iconic songs of Jose Mari Chan. <br>
                
                <br>Playing the role of Miko, one of the quartet airport carollers, Yarcia proves he is a valuable addition in an ensemble of veteran and newcomers in the country's vibrant theater scene. <br>
                
                <br>"I feel very happy kasi this has been my dream since childhood, makapag-perform, maka-act, kumanta with movement din. To be with this cast full of amazing performers, it's such an honor," he told ABS-CBN News. <br>
                
                <br>Yarcia joins the likes of Carla Guevara Laforteza, Floyd Tena, and Neomi Gonzales who are mainstays in Philippine stage productions. <br>
                
                <br>Together with Julia Serad, Roxy Aldiosa, and Johann Enriquez, he sang "A Wish on Christmas Night," "The Bells at Christmas," and "Ring in the New." <br>
                
                <br>In 2019, then a college freshman, Yarcia joined the prestigious Philippine Madrigal Singers, touring the world for various performances and competitions. He was also part of the premier group's 60th anniversary concert. <br>
                
                <br>And if that's not enough, the 25-year-old baritone recently graduated from the UP College of Music with a degree in voice, Summa Cum Laude. <br>
                
                <br>Asked why he is pursuing a seeming redirection of his career from chorale music to theater, Yarcia said this is part of his evolution as an artist. <br>
                
                <br>In fact, he said his rigorous training in the "Madz" made him sharper in his performances, which is evident in his portrayal of a singer role. <br>
                
                <br>"I don't think I really left. Choir singing, it's always gonna be in my heart, and in my soul. I'm a choir singer forever. Gamit na gamit ko nga pagiging korista ko sa music rehearsals," he explained. <br>
                
                <br>"I also just graduated this year and that's a sign for me to pursue a solo career," he added. <br>
                
                <br>When not onstage, Yarcia teaches voice to children and young adults at the RMA Studio Academy. He said he is yearning to do more projects in the future. <br>

                <br>"I plan to join more productions in the future, continue music-making, and spread the magic of our culture and our music to others. Gusto kong makapag-perform in different places, in the country and abroad," he said. <br>
                
                <br>"I also hope to be able to do music cultural exchanges, helping to spread and educate others about the beauty of our own music, such as the Kundiman, while also learning about their own music." <br>
                
                <br>With many titles under his belt and a huge potential to make it big, Yarcia is just getting started. <br>
                
                <br>"I want to be able to share the wonder, the beauty of our culture here and abroad," he ended.</p>

            <h1>Taylor Swift closed her Eras tour on top of the world. </h1>
            <p>Published Dec 13, 2024 12:45 PM PHT</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../images/music3.webp" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>NEW YORK -- The nearly two-year-long, $2-billion Eras Tour shattered records, made history and quite literally triggered earthquakes -- so what could Taylor Swift, the planet's biggest star, possibly do next? <br>

                <br>"Taylor Swift just needs to rest, frankly," said Andrew Mall, an ethnomusicologist at Northeastern University. <br>
                
                <br>It's a wholly reasonable sentiment when you look at what the megastar, who turns 35 on Friday, has accomplished, including releasing nine albums in five years alongside a concert feature film. <br>
                
                <br>The career-spanning global odyssey of a tour she just staged was like nothing that came before it: 149 shows across the world that typically clocked in at more than three hours long each.<br>
                
                <br>Eras Tour tickets sold for sometimes exorbitant prices and drew in millions of fans, along with many more who didn't get in and were willing to simply sing along from the parking lot.<br>
                
                <br>"I think she can't top it right away," Mall told AFP. "There's just no possible way she can turn around and launch something else that has as large an impact, cultural and economic." <br>
                
                <br>For Kristin Lieb, an expert at Emerson College on pop, gender and branding, the question of what's next isn't even particularly fair. <br>
                
                <br>"The minute you finish a marathon, or the minute you win the World Series, or the minute somebody gets tenure, you know, the first question is, what are you going to do next?" she told AFP. "I'm starting to make sense of that as a real cultural sickness." <br>
                
                <br>'Up to her' <br>
                <br>But in an industry that's constantly seeking what's young, new or fresh, "what's next" is nevertheless always front of mind. <br>
                
                <br>The Swifties are still waiting on more "Taylor's Version" albums: Since 2021 Swift has been making good on her vow to re-record her first six studio records in a bid to own the rights to them. <br>
                
                <br>She's got two left -- "Reputation" and "Taylor Swift."
                
                <br>Swift also has the Grammys in early February to look forward to, with six nominations including three in the most prestigious categories for her latest studio album, "The Tortured Poets Department," her fifth since 2019. <br>
                
                <br>At this year's gala she used her award acceptance speeches to announce that new album -- another surprise up her sleeve would surely delight fans. <br>
                
                <br>But looking past "what's next" is perhaps a larger question: how does an artist define success when they're already a cultural phenomenon, awash in riches and fame? <br>
                
                <br>"The good news for her is, like, she's literally the biggest star in the world, and so that is entirely up to her at this point," said Lieb. <br>
                
                <br>Live albums, a Vegas residency, further extending her incredibly recognizable brand into products? Anything is possible at the House of Swift. <br>
                
                <br>Years ago it was announced she had penned an original screenplay and would be making her feature directorial debut with Searchlight Pictures -- so maybe she now has her sights set on the Oscars. <br>
                
                <br>Swiftie loyalty <br>
                <br>In any case, at this point Swift doesn't necessarily need to keep her fans constantly fed to keep them loyal. <br>
                
                <br>She's fostered a community that is somewhat self-sustaining -- a contemporary, mostly online version of the fan engagement the Grateful Dead pioneered, which saw Deadheads commune in their reverence for the band. <br>
                 
                <br>Swifties might honor a request from their beloved to give her time and space, Lieb said. "I do think that she's cultivated a relationship with them such that they could hear that and respect that." <br>
                
                <br>The Eras Tour, Mall pointed out, also bloomed from years of prolific music-making and audience-building -- so she might need time to develop more material before accomplishing another feat of that magnitude, if that's a goal of hers. <br>
                
                <br>And in the mix of everyone else's expectations, Lieb said Swift might want to take a moment to consider what it is she herself wants: "What would be challenging and fulfilling for her?" <br>
                
                <br>Swift does of course have a personal life, famously so: for more than a year she's been very publicly dating NFL star Travis Kelce, and might want simply enjoy herself and the fruits of her labor. <br>
                
                <br>And in the grand scheme of it all, a key question remains: "Do we need Taylor Swift, or does she need us?" said Mall. "I think she doesn't need us, right?" <br>
                
                <br>"And maybe we do her."</p>

            <p>MANILA -- Devoted fans, particularly in the Philippines, will go to any length to collect every item dedicated to their idols. <br>

                <br>With everyone involved, including the fans, helping them reach the top, BINI and SB19 became household names and are regarded as two of the country's major pop groups. <br>
                
                <br>Blooms (BINI fans) and A'tin (SB19 fans) have always been there to support BINI and SB19 concerts and events, and they will continue to do so. <br>
                
                <br>Due to high demand, the limited-edition BINI and SB19 Puregold Perks Card is now available at over 100 new Puregold stores, including Visayas and Mindanao locations, making it more accessible to Pinoy shoppers. <br>
                
                
                <br>The brand's new Perks Card includes unique photographs of the massively popular BINI and SB19, as well as their official logos and member card information in one corner. The Perks Card is part of the artists' "Nasa Atin ang Panalo" cooperation with the brand, and it allows fans to receive the brand’s incentives while also possessing a unique collectible item. <br>
                
                <br>“We are very happy with the warm reception for the BINI and SB19 Puregold Perks Card,” said Ivy Hayagan-Piedad, the company’s senior marketing manager. “Bringing the special edition card to more stores nationwide is definitely part of Puregold’s fun collaboration with BINI and SB19.” <br>
                
                <br>The BINI and SB19 perks card is now available in a new set of Luzon stores, including high-traffic regions around Metro Manila and neighboring provinces such as Angeles, Antipolo, Baler, Calamba, La Union, and others. <br>
                
                <br>When new members sign up at specific Puregold locations, they can choose between receiving a BINI or SB19 card. To get these limited-edition cards, new members can pay a membership fee of P100. <br>
                
                <br>Current members can exchange their old cards for the new Perks Cards by paying a P100 replacement charge. Brand’s members who signed up online can exchange their cards for a BINI or SB19 special edition card for a P100 charge.</p>

            <p>Who would have thought that the time would come that we’re going to see two of the biggest and brightest stars in the country—Vice Ganda and SB19—in one frame? <br>

                <br>From having a special participation in the Magpasikat 2024 number of Team Vice-Karylle-Ryan and lending their hit song “Mapa” as the official soundtrack of the Unkabogable Star’s upcoming entry to the 2024 Metro Manila Film Festival, “And The Breadwinner Is…”, the acclaimed Pinoy Pop group went on to grace her latest vlog, where they amused us with their brutal “puksaan” or poking fun at each other. <br>
                
                <br>Being the gracious host that she is, as well as her way of promoting her highly anticipated movie, Vice brought them three different kinds of breads, which she named after the group and their songs: 19 pieces of Spanish bread (for “SB19”), ensaymada (for ensay-“Mapa”), mamon (for ma-”Moonlight”), and pandesal (for “Pan de Stell”). <br>
                
                <br>She started their chikahan with a brief kumustahan, quizzing Stell, Pablo, Ken, Josh, and Justin who among them is the “pinakamakulit,” “pinakapikon,” “pinakasensitive,” “palaging may opinion,” and “laging kawawa.” They also candidly opened up about their love experiences prior to their fame, as well as their camaraderie as a group. <br>
                
                <br>While they typically take their performances extremely seriously, SB19 showed off their fun and lighthearted side as they played the popular game "Suspect, Suspect," which Vice recommended. The five lads apparently had a great time “roasting” or exposing each other, as they revealed hilarious, intriguing, and even startling trivia about the “suspect” or one member. And just like any production number of theirs, the five talented lads also took the game seriously as they huddled for them to make completely humorous revelations for their cherished fellow member. <br>
                
                <br>Vice went on to express how proud she is of them for all the achievements and recognitions they have received either as a group or individual artist ever since they started in 2018 both here in the Philippines and abroad. She also reminisced on their guesting in “Gandang Gabi Vice“ many years ago when they were just new in the entertainment industry, recalling how they’ve been already deeply adored at the time and how elated they were to appear on the defunct late-night comedy talk show. <br>
                
                <br>Vice had them talk about their experiences as the “breadwinner” or main providers in their respective families. While Ken, Josh, and Stell have already assumed the responsibility of providing for their loved ones even though they were not asked to do so, Pablo and Josh disclosed that they don’t play the role in their households. Pablo imparted that he has brothers to help him not just in their family’s finances but in his career also, while Josh happily implied that happiness and pride more than the money were his greatest gift and contribution to his family. <br>
                
                <br>Watch the full vlog to get a glimpse of SB19 off the stage, learn more about them through their insightful and lighthearted conversation with Vice, and see for yourselves how they wildly poked fun at each other! <br>
                
                <br>And this coming Christmas, everyone is enjoined to watch “And The Breadwinner Is…,” an official entry to the 50th Metro Manila Film Festival, topbilled by the one and only Unkabogable Star Vice Ganda and helmed by award-winning director Jun Robles Lana. The comedy-drama film also stars Eugene Domingo, Jhong Hilario, Gladys Reyes, Malou de Guzman, Joel Torre, Maris Racal, Kokoy de Santos, Anthony Jennings, Lassy Marquez, MC Muah, Via Antonio, Argus Aspiras, and Kulot Caponpon.</p>
